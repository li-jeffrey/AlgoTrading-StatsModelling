    "## Leverage*\n",
    "Leverage is a tool used for multiplying out returns. It can also lead to an increased loss. If we have a confident strategy, it is an effective way of increasing our returns. Note that leverage can come in many forms. The type we will be dealing with in this section will be on margin trading. This involves taking out a loan from your broker and adding it to your capital base in order to increase the returns of your trading strategy. Obviously in order to make this profitable, our returns should be greater than the interest needed to pay the debt.\n",

    "Comparing returns of different investment opportunities without taking risk into account is meaningless. We want to see whether a (high) return stream is due to a (high) amount of risks taken rather than a well-performing strategy. Thus, we have risk-adjusted returns and methods of risk-adjustment. If we adjust several return streams for risk then we can consider them on equal footing, independent of the risk. This allows us to effectively compare and determine which return streams are the best for a given desired risk profile.\n",

    "\n",
    "A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates that you are getting more return relative to the risk that your strategy is taking on. We compare the Sharpe Ratio of two strategies of interest and then pick the strategy with the better Sharpe Ratio. Using leverage, we can multiply the returns up to the desired level. Assuming constraints like capital capacity don't kick in, adding more money through leverage can bring a 2% per year strategy up to a 10% per year strategy while maintaining the same Sharpe. We can also invest a fraction of your available capital to bring a per year strategy's risk down to acceptable levels."
